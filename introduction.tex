\chapter{Introduction}

Biobank version 4 is a rewrite of the Biobank application, meant to provide the
majority of its functionality through a web browser based interface. It was
designed using Domain Driven Design principles \cite{evans2004domain} and
employs a CQRS architecture (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
\cite{vernon2013implementing}.

In addition, version 4 includes enhancements to the domain model which provides
better workflow and an improved user experience.

Flatbed scanning is supported by having a separate dedicated client, but this
client's functionality is focused only on scanning and decoding tubes etched
with 2D barcodes.

\section{CQRS}

The main reasons for choosing a CQRS architecture are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Employs a message-based system that allows for decoupling and is more
  reliable against transient failures.
\item \textbf{Commands} (that change data) are separated from \textbf{queries}
  (that read data).
\item Enables domain driven design by capturing the intent in the form of
commands.
\item \textbf{Event Sourcing} allows persisting of application entities as a
  sequence of events that created them. Thus, captures all business changes in a
  lossless manner.
\item Events are used to populate views also known as the reporting side. Thus,
  allows for decoupling of domain logic from reporting.
\item Allows for definitions of new reports that provide new insight to the
  data that has already been captured.
\end{itemize}
