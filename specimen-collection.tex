\chapter{Specimen Collection}

The \entitytarget{Participant} aggregate records specimens collected
from study participants. Before specimen collection can be used, the
participant must be created. Participants cannot be added to a
\entitylink{Study} that is not enabled.

Figure \ref{fig:participant-aggregate} shows the composition of this aggregate.
A participant has a unique identifier that is used to identify the participant
in the system. This identifier is not the same as the
\valobjlink{ParticipantId} value object used by the domain model.

\subsection*{CollectionEvent}
Represents a visit made by a \entitylink{Participant} during which
\entitylink{Specimen}s may have been collected and other information may have
been recorded.

\subsection*{ParticipantAnnotation}
This entity holds the annotation value for the
\entitylink{ParticipantAnnotationType} defined in the study. See Chapter
\ref{chap:annotations} for how annotation values are recorded.

\subsection*{ParticipantComment}
A \entitytarget{ParticipantComment} contains a textual message and the user
that added the comment. The date and time the comment was made is recorded as
meta data. A participant can have one or more comments.

\section{CollectionEvent Details}

The \entitytarget{CollectionEvent} is used to record a visit by a participant
to a \entitylink{Center} (e.g. a clinic). A collection event must have a
\entitylink{CollectionEventType} as defined by the study. See Section
\ref{sec:collection-event-type} for more details on the collection event type.

A collection event also has a \compfont{visitNumber} that is an integer and a
\compfont{timeDone} which is a time stamp for when the participant made the
visit to the center. The format for the time stamp is: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Specimen}
One or more specimens may have been collected from the participant. Each
specimen is recorded with the collection event. More information for the
\entitylink{Specimen} aggregate root is given in Chapter
\ref{chap:specimen-processing}.

\valobjtarget{SpecimenCollectionEvent} is used to associate a specimen to a
collection event. It is possible that a specimen has multiple collection events
for the case when specimens are trasnferred from one study to another. By
having multiple collection events, the information from the original collection
event is not lost for the specimen. It is not recommended that a specimen have
multiple collection events within the same study.

\subsection*{CollectionEventAnnotation}
This entity holds the annotation value for the
\entitylink{CollectionEventTypeAnnotationType} defined in the study. See Chapter
\ref{chap:annotations} for how annotation values are recorded.

\subsection*{CollectionEventComment}
A \entitytarget{CollectionEventComment} contains a textual message and the user
that added the comment. The date and time the comment was made is recorded as
meta data. A collection event can have one or more comments.
