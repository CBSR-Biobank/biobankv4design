\chapter{Centre Shipment}
\label{chap:centre-shipment}

Shipments allow for specimens or containers to be transferred from one centre
to another. E.g. collecting centres send to processing centres, storage centres
send to request centres, etc. Figure \ref{fig:centre-shipment} shows that
shipments are managed by the \entitylink{Centre} aggregate root.

Since a centre could have multiple locations, \entitytarget{Shipment}s have a
\compfont{fromLocation} and a \compfont{toLocation} which identify the two
\entitylink{Centre}s involved. Both these centres must be enabled for the
shipment to be allowed.

A shipment has a state which is one of the following:
\begin{statetable}
  CREATED & The shipment is in the process of being created.\\

  PACKED & The shipment is put together in a box, but not sent out.\\

  SENT & The shipment has been sent (possibly by a courier) to its destination.\\

  RECEIVED & The shipment has arrived at its expected destination, but has not
  been unpacked.\\

  UNPACKED & The shipment has arrived and its contents were confirmed.\\

  LOST & The shipment never arrived and may never arrive.\\
\end{statetable}

The shipment also records when the shipment was packed, sent, received and
unpacked. These are recorded as date and time stamps. Figure \ref{fig:shipment}
shows the remainder of the model for shipments.

\subsection*{ShipmentContainer}
\entitytarget{ShipmentContainer} is used to add a container to a shipment.
An container at a storage center can be shipped, and if it contains specimens,
then all specimens are also added to the shipment. The shipment container has a
state and is one of the following:

\begin{statetable}
  PRESENT & The item was recorded as shipped out, but it's not known yet
  whether it is received, missing, or lost.\\

  RECEIVED & The item was recorded as sent from the source location and arrived
  as expected at the destination location.\\

  MISSING & The item was recorded as sent but never showed up in a shipment.\\

  EXTRA & The item was never recorded as sent and showed up unexpectedly in a
  shipment.\\
\end{statetable}

\subsection*{ShipmentSpecimen}
\entitytarget{ShipmentSpecimen} is used to add a specimen at any center to a
shipment.  A shipment specimen has a state and is the same as the ones for a
\entitylink{ShipmentContainer} as described above.

\subsection*{ShipmentData}
The \valobjtarget{ShipmentData} value object records the courier company's name
and the package's tracking number.

\subsection*{ShipmentComment}
A \entitytarget{ShipmentComment} contains a textual message and the user that
added the comment. The date and time the comment was made is recorded as meta
data. A shipment can have one or more comments.
